## 🧮 Sample DAX Measures

Below are some of the key DAX expressions used in this report:

```DAX
-- Calculate Churn Rate
Churn Rate % = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Customer, Customer[Attrition_Flag] = "Attrited Customer")),
    COUNTROWS(Customer),
    0
)

-- Calculate Total Revenue Loss
Total Revenue Loss = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(Customer, Customer[Attrition_Flag] = "Attrited Customer"),
    Customer[Revenue]
)

-- Identify High Risk Customers
High Risk Customers = 
COUNTROWS(FILTER(Customer, Customer[Churn Risk] = "High"))
````
